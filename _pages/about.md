I am a second year PhD student at INRIA [Thoth] (https://team.inria.fr/thoth/), and at [EDF R&D] (https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/inventing-the-future-of-energy/r-d-global-expertise). I work under the supervision of [Pierre Gaillard] (http://pierre.gaillard.me/index.html), from INRIA, [Nadia Oudjane] (https://fime-lab.org/oudjane-nadia/), from EDF R&D and [Margaux Brégère] (https://margauxbregere.github.io/), from both EDF R&D and Sorbonne Université probability, statistics and modelisation lab [(LPSM)] (https://www.lpsm.paris/).

My research focuses on the intersection of reinforcement learning and online learning algorithms, particularly within the context of mean field games and mean field control. I am interested in understanding the theoretical aspects of sequential decision making while also exploring their practical applications in energy management scenarios.
